            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS His Sacred Majesty, in his Brief graciously granted for the Relief of the <hi>French Protestants,</hi> hath commended the pursuit of that Brief to the Paternal Care of the Bishops of every Diocese; requiring them to give particular recommendation and command to all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Vicars, and Curates, in their respective Dioceses, for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing so pious and charitable a Work. And whereas His Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty (as appears by the Brief) requires, That only such Motives as are contained in the Brief (for better cannot) should be made use of to induce People freely and chearfully to contribute to the Relief of those poor and afflicted Protestants. In Obedience to His Sacred Majesty's Command, I recommend to you (and you may recommend to the People) such Motives as these (expresly grounded on his Majesty's Brief.) As,</p>

               <item>1. His Majesty's gracious and charitable Example, who (besides other Testimonies of his Royal Pity and Bounty towards them) has taken them into his Protection, and granted them this Brief.</item>
               <item>2. His Majesty declares it to be agreeable to the Laws of Christian Charity, and common Bonds of Humanity, to take their deplorable condition into his Tender Care and Princely Commiseration; and therefore those Laws and Bonds of Christianity and Humanity, bind all his Subjects (according to their ability) to commiserate them, and contribute to their Relief.</item>
               <item>3. If we consider their Quality and Religion, they are Christians, and Protestants, conformable to the Government of our Church and State.</item>
               <item>4. If we consider the sad condition they are now in, being reduced to extream want and necessities, and in a deplorable condition.</item>
               <item>5. If we consider the great Numbers of them (of which the Brief assures us.) All these Considerations (which are expressed in the Brief) should be effectual Motives, to induce all pious and charitable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to commiserate their afflicted Brethren, and to contribute libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to their Relief. That so the Charity and Collection might have some proportion with the Number and Necessities of those for whom it is collected.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These and such other Motives (provided that they be indeed groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Brief) you may, and ought to use, to perswade the People under your Charge and Cure, to a liberal Contribution. For this (as you may see by the express words of the Brief) his Sacred Majesty (out of his Great Charity to the poor afflicted <hi>French Protestants</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; and if you chearfully obey, (as I hope and believe you will) it will be an acceptable Service both to God and the King. This, in Obedience to his Sacred Majesty's Command, and according to my Duty, is signifi'd to you, by</p>
